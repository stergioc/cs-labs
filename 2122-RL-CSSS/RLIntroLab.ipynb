        "These plots help clarify the performance differences between the different step sizes. A step size of 0.01 makes such small updates that the agent’s value estimate of the best action does not get close to the actual value. Step sizes of 0.5 and 1.0 both get close to the true value quickly, but are very susceptible to stochasticity in the rewards. The updates overcorrect too much towards recent rewards, and so oscillate around the true value. This means that on many steps, the action that pulls the best arm may seem worse than it actually is.  A step size of 0.1 updates fairly quickly to the true value, and does not oscillate as widely around the true values as 0.5 and 1.0. This is one of the reasons that 0.1 performs quite well. Finally we see why 1/N(A) performed well. Early on while the step size is still reasonably high it moves quickly to the true expected value, but as it gets pulled more its step size is reduced which makes it less susceptible to the stochasticity of the rewards.\n",
        "\n",
        "Does this mean that 1/N(A) is always the best? When might it not be? One possible setting where it might not be as effective is in non-stationary problems. You learned about non-stationarity in the lessons. Non-stationarity means that the environment may change over time. This could manifest itself as continual change over time of the environment, or a sudden change in the environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at how a sudden change in the reward distributions affects a step size like 1/N(A). This time we will run the environment for 2000 steps, and after 1000 steps we will randomly change the expected value of all of the arms. We compare two agents, both using epsilon-greedy with epsilon = 0.1. One uses a constant step size of 0.1, the other a step size of 1/N(A) that reduces over time. "
